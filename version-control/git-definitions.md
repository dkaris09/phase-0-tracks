# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a way to monitor alterations to project files by viewing all the different commits (savepoints) by other users over the project's lifetime. This allows you to correct mistakes and check the project's history.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is just another local repo that has a copy of a project. You can finish projects quicker and easier if you divide up the work among programmers in local repos so each programmer can have their own computer to work on a section of the assignment. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is the last part of the staging process a file goes through where you finally commit to creating a savepoint in Git for your work. A good commit message explains the reason you are saving your work for future reference.

* What is a merge conflict?

If you merge code from your local repo with the master branch, you may experience a merge conflict where there are conflicting lines of code. A common example of this is an edit collision where two branches alter the same part of a file and try to merge it with the master branch.
