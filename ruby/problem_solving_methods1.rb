# Release 2: Sort an Array 
 
#the bubble sort algorithm sorts a collection by moving from left to right, comparing a value with the
#next value to determine which value is higher (or lower depending on the goal). Typically it iterates 
#through the entire list many times in order to properly sort a collection.
