Release 1: Find a Real-Life Algorithm

My real life example of an algorithm I use is my login info at atm

user = "Chase0011"

puts "Username:"
user_input = gets.chomp

password = "wireh01"
puts "Password:"
pw_input = gets.chomp

while user_input != user || pw_inut != password
	puts "Incorrect log-in info. Please try again."
	puts "Username:"
	user_input = gets.chomp
	puts "Password:"
	pw_input = gets.chomp
end

puts "Welcome back, #{user}!"
